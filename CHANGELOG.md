## [next]
- BREAKING: Rename feature 'serde' as 'serde_feature' (for technical reasons)

## [0.32.0] - 2020-07-09
### Changes
- Method `seq_len()` of `bam::Record` is now public.
- Speedup when parsing BAM headers (thanks to @juliangehring).
- Compatibility fixes for older rust versions (thanks to @pmarks and @brainstorm).

## [0.31.0] - 2020-06-22
### Changes
- Bam record buffer now returns reference counted (Rc) objects. This makes the API more ergonomic to use.
- Switched to thiserror instead of snafu for error handling.
- Various cleanups and little fixes.

## [0.30.0] - 2020-04-03
### Changes
- Removed `fn header_mut()` from `bam::Read` trait.
- Fixed a major performance regression when reading bam files (issue #195).

## [0.29.0] - 2020-03-26
### Changes
- Migrate buffer intervals to u64. 

## [0.28.0] - 2020-03-26
### Changes
- Return u64 wherever htslib has migrated to using 64 bit.
- Implement more bio-types (Interval, Locus, Strand).

## [0.27.0] - 2020-03-17
### Changes
- Updated to Htslib 1.10.2.
- bam::Record.set() will panic if seq.len() != qual.len(). Previously, mismatched length would cause
  uninitialized memory to be written into the BAM file.
- use `serde_bytes` to serialize .data section of bam::Record when using serde - large speed improvement.
- change build.rs to avoid re-running when htslib or wrapper.h haven't changed.
- update some dependencies.
- refactor native dependency into htslib-sys crate, for greater versioning flexibility
- Record::from_sam require `&mut HeaderView`. Provide the appropriate accessor.
- set() no longer invalidates tag data.
- Various minor improvements.

## [0.26.1] - 2019-12-03
### Changes
- Various bug fixes in CIGAR string handling, INFO tag reading and FORMAT tag reading.

## [0.26.0] - 2019-09-27
### Changes
- Allow caching of CIGAR in bam::RecordBuffer.

## [0.25.0] - 2019-09-27
### Changes
- Migrated error handling to the snafu crate: https://docs.rs/snafu.
- Cleaned up and simplified API (including breaking changes).
- Allow writing SAM files from the bam::Writer.

## [0.24.0] - 2019-05-31
### Added
- Allow setting unmapped BAM record (without Cigar string).
- Various bug fixes and error handling improvements.
- Various Pysam-derived methods for interpreting Cigar strings.

## [0.23.0] - 2019-05-02
### Added
- Support for BAM indices that are not placed beside a file.bam as file.bam.bai
- Implement SequenceRead trait for BAM records.
- Add function to build an index for a BAM file.

## [0.21.0] - 2018-08-01
### Changes

- Adding `bcf::Record::unpack()` for explicitely unpacking BCF records.
- Fixed `bcf::synced::SyncedReader::record()`.
- `bam::Record::cigar()` now returns a reference (in constant time) and needs `bam::Record::unpack_cigar()` to be called first.
- Allow to create Cigar string from `bio_types::Alignment`.
- Provide a cached variant of obtaining cigar string.
- Lots of small usability improvements.
